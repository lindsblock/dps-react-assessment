started Wednesday 9:30pm. set up everything and now I don't think I understand how to get the stuff from the database.

Thursday started 9:00 pm. I'm stupid and took 45 minutes trying to change the background color from black so I could
actually read what was rendering. Go me.

Saturday: started 12:00 pm. took me two hours but I finally got beers to show up and I am stoked. Didn't think I would even be able to do that much so yay.

Sunday started at 11am.
